Winning in a team doesn’t feel as good as winning by myself
( Blue 0, Red 3, Clear 0, Black 2, White -3, Green -2, Yellow 0, Purple 0, Natural 1.5, Parchment 0)
I hate it when other people team up against me
( Blue -1, Red -0.5, Clear 0, Black 1, White 3, Green 2.5, Yellow -0.5, Purple -1, Natural 2, Parchment -2)
I am the one in the group to suggest a party game
( Blue 2.5, Red 0, Clear -1.5, Black 2, White 3, Green 0, Yellow 3, Purple 3, Natural -3, Parchment -2.5)
I would rather play a solo game than a 3-4 player one
( Blue -2, Red -3, Clear 2, Black -3, White 1, Green 2.5, Yellow -2, Purple -3, Natural 2, Parchment 0)
If enough people want to play a game I despise, I’ll play it anyways
