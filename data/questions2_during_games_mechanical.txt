I rarely second guess myself when making ordinary moves
( Blue -1, Red -2, Clear 0, Black 1, White -1, Green 0, Yellow -1, Purple 0.5, Natural -2, Parchment 0.5)
I feel the most comfortable with a long term strategy
( Blue 0, Red 1.5, Clear 0, Black -1, White 0, Green 2, Yellow -1, Purple -1, Natural 2, Parchment 1.5)
When the game is too complicated, I quickly feel overwhelmed
( Blue 2, Red -3, Clear 0, Black -2, White 2, Green -1, Yellow -1, Purple 3, Natural -2, Parchment -1)
Winning is everything, no matter what.
( Blue -2.5, Red 3, Clear -2, Black -2.5, White 0, Green -2, Yellow -3, Purple -2, Natural -2.5, Parchment -1.5)
I enjoy beating my high score from a previous game (during games mechanical)
( Blue 0, Red 3, Clear 1, Black -3, White 1, Green 2.5, Yellow -3, Purple 0, Natural 2, Parchment 1)
How likely are you to read the rules while someone is explaining?
( Blue -3, Red 2, Clear -1, Black 1.5, White -3, Green 1.5, Yellow -2, Purple -3, Natural 3, Parchment 2)
I can take in a lot of information at once
( Blue 0, Red 3, Clear 0, Black 2, White -1, Green 0, Yellow 1.5, Purple -2, Natural 2, Parchment 1)
When doing certain phases of the game, they must be done from start to finish every time
( Blue -1, Red 2.5, Clear 0, Black 1, White 0, Green 0, Yellow -2, Purple -3, Natural 3, Parchment 0)
If we misinterpret a crucial rule, the game doesn’t count
( Blue -2, Red -2, Clear 1.5, Black -2, White 2, Green 1, Yellow -3, Purple -3, Natural 3, Parchment -1)
Games often don’t go according to my plan - and that’s okay
( Blue 1.5, Red -2, Clear 0, Black 2, White 0, Green -2, Yellow 2, Purple 1, Natural -2, Parchment 1)
