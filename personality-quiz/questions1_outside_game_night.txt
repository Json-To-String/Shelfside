I am THE one in the group to buy games.

I consult my friends first before I buy a game.

When I walk into a board game store, I have no idea what to buy.
( Blue -2, Red -0.5, Clear 0, Black 1, White 0.5, Green -2, Yellow 3, Purple 1, Natural -2.5, Parchment -2)
I feel comfortable buying what the store employee recommends.

If the game is worth it, I’m willing to spend some more money.

I have my own dedicated space for games and board gaming.

I enjoy being the one to host board game night whenever possible.

I like looking for new board games to crowdfund.

For some reason I know whether or not I’ll like a game right after reading the rules without even having to play it.

I like talking about board game mechanics to friends that’ll listen.
( Blue 1, Red 1.5, Clear 1, Black 0, White 0, Green 0, Yellow -2, Purple -1, Natural 3, Parchment 2.5)
I’ll read the rulebook for a new game before game night, even if someone else knows how to play.
