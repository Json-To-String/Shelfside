I am THE one in the group to buy games
( Blue 2, Red 1, Clear 2.5, Black -1, White 0, Green 2.5, Yellow 0, Purple 2, Natural 3, Parchment 2)
I consult my friends first before I buy a game
( Blue 2, Red -1, Clear -3, Black 2, White 2.5, Green -2, Yellow 1, Purple 2, Natural -3, Parchment 1.5)
When I walk into a board game store, I get confused with what I see
( Blue -2, Red -0.5, Clear -2, Black 1, White 0, Green -2, Yellow 3, Purple 1, Natural -2.5, Parchment -2)
I feel comfortable buying what the store employee recommends
( Blue 2, Red 1, Clear -2, Black 2, White 1.5, Green 1.5, Yellow 0, Purple 2, Natural -2.5, Parchment 0.5)
If the game is worth it, I’m willing to spend some more money.

I have a dedicated space for games and board gaming
( Blue 3, Red 0, Clear 1.5, Black -1, White 0, Green 2.5, Yellow -2, Purple 1, Natural 3, Parchment 1.5)
I enjoy being the one to host board game night whenever possible.

I like looking for new board games to crowdfund

For some reason I know whether or not I’ll like a game right after reading the rules without even having to play it
( Blue 1.5, Red 2, Clear 0, Black 2, White 1, Green 1.5, Yellow -2, Purple -2, Natural 3, Parchment 1.5)
I like talking about board game mechanics to anyone that’ll listen
( Blue 1, Red 1, Clear 1, Black 0, White 0, Green 0, Yellow -2, Purple -1, Natural 3, Parchment 2.5)
I’ll read the rulebook for the game before game night, even if someone else knows how to play
( Blue -2, Red 2.5, Clear -1, Black 1, White 0, Green 2, Yellow -2.5, Purple -3, Natural 3, Parchment 1.5)
