Ok! Now let’s make the questions trickier for the home stretch!

I find myself reaching for the rulebook mid-game (During games mechanical/social)
( Blue 1.5, Red 3, Clear 1, Black 2, White -1, Green 0, Yellow -2, Purple -3, Natural 3, Parchment 2.5)
I like to play board games to relax (During games mechanical/social)
( Blue 0, Red -2, Clear 2, Black -2, White 2, Green 3, Yellow 1, Purple -3, Natural -1, Parchment 1)
If a decision sounds fun, I’ll go with it even if it might not end up perfect (During games mechanical/social)
( Blue 2.5, Red -2.5, Clear 0, Black 2, White 0, Green 1, Yellow 2.5, Purple 2, Natural 0, Parchment 3)
I zone out and participate less when I’m behind in a game and my options are limited (games mechanically/socially)
( Blue -2, Red -2.5, Clear 0, Black 2, White -1.5, Green -3, Yellow 3, Purple 2, Natural 1, Parchment -0.5)
I like to imagine what my pieces are doing conceptually between turns. (Playing games mechanical/social)
( Blue 0, Red 0, Clear 1, Black 2, White 0, Green 3, Yellow 2, Purple -1, Natural 1, Parchment 2.5)
