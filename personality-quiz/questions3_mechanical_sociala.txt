Winning in a team against the game doesn’t feel as good as winning by myself.

I hate it when other people team up and act against me.

I am the one in the group to suggest a short party game.
( Blue 2.5, Red 0, Clear -1.5, Black 2, White 1, Green 0, Yellow 3, Purple 3, Natural -3, Parchment -2.5)
I would rather play a solo game than a 3-4 player one.

If enough people want to play a filler (i.e. shorter game) I tend to dislike *twice* in a row, I’ll go along with it.
